We are going to calculate someone buying a car online Like car Guru (However, very simplified).
We will be using JavaFX.
We will have a selection of 4 different car types.
We will have 3 options to choose from (Manual 4-Speed Transmission, Manual 5-Speed Transmission, & Automatic Transmission). 
The manual transmission option are for those people that like to feel that they are actually doing something. lol.
